The moon illusion is a classic psychology case study that investigates the reason the moon appears larger when it is close to the horizon and 
why the moon looks smaller as it ascends away from the horizon. It was a mystery until it was shown that our psychology does effect our perception. I wanted to include an interesting problem in my curriculum so I chose this.
