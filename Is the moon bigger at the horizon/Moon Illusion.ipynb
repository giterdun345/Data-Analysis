    "Why does the moon appear to be so much larger when it is near the horizon than when it is directly overhead? This question has produced a wide variety of theories from psychologists. An important early hypothesis was put forth by Holway and Boring (1940) who suggested that the illusion was due to the fact that when the moon was on the horizon, the observer looked straight at it with eyes level, whereas when it was at its zenith, the observer had to elevate his or her eyes as well as his or her head to see it. To test this hypothesis, Kaufman and Rock (1962) devised an apparatus that allowed them to present two artificial moons, one at the horizon and one at the zenith, and to control whether the subjects elevated their eyes or kept them level to see the zenith moon. The horizon, or comparison, moon was always viewed with eyes level. Subjects were asked to adjust the variable horizon moon to match the size of the zenith moon or vice versa. For each subject the ratio of the perceived size of the horizon moon to the perceived size of the zenith moon was recorded with eyes elevated and with eyes level. A ratio of 1.00 would represent no illusion. If Holway and Boring were correct, there should be a greater illusion in the eyes-elevated condition than in the eyes-level condition.\n",

If the moon looks just a tiny bit larger at the horizon, that may not be that big of a deal. Recall the nature of our dependent variable. Participants looked at the moon high in the sky and adjusted a “moon” off to one side to appear to be the same size as the real moon. Then they looked at the moon just above the horizon, and made a  similar  adjustment.  If  there  were no moon illusion,  the  two  settings  would  be about the same, and their ratio would be about 1.00. But in actual fact, the settings for the horizon moon were much larger than the settings for the zenith moon, and the average ratio of these two settings was 1.463. This means that, on average, the moon on the horizon appeared to be 1.463 times larger (or 46.3% larger) than the moon at its zenith.\n",

We don’t have to get fancy. When you tell your readers that the moon at the horizon appears nearly half again as large as the moon at its zenith, you are telling them something more than simply that the horizon moon appears significantky larger. You  are certainly telling them much more than saying that the average setting for the horizon moon was 5.23 centimeters. In  this example we have a situation where the ratios that we collect are such that we can express important information simply by telling the reader what the mean ratio was. It now makes sense here to say that “people perceive a moon on the horizon to be nearly 1.5 times as large as the apparent size of the moon at its zenith.”"
